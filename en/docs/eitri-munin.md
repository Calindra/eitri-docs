# Eitri Munin

Munin (which means "memory" or "mind") is one of the two ravens of Odin and inspired the name of our data persistence feature.

With it, you can store information related to an Eitri-App in an easy, quick, and practical manner, having a database at your disposal for storing and querying information without the need to worry about the infrastructure for it.

Munin will soon be available for use in your Eitri-apps.
