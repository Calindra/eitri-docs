# Push Notification

Eitri App Shopping apps comes with seemless integration with [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging){:target="_blank"} but it's possible to fire push notification through other service providers.

The use of deeplinks in your push configuration can vary depending on your app’s implementation and the service provider you use.

If your app uses Eitri Shopping’s default deeplink solution, check out [our deeplinks documentation](deeplinks.md) to learn how to structure and use deeplinks.

You can also customize Eitri Shopping’s default deeplinks to change how your app supports and routes deeplinks. To learn more, see the [documentation for deeplinks addon](https://github.com/eitri-tech/eitri-shopping-addons){:target="_blank"}.
