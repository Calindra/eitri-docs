# What is Eitri?

Eitri is a mobile development platform that makes it easier and faster to develop and publish new features in your app. With Eitri, you can lower your costs and raise your productivity focusing on your product with intelligent metrics that enhance performance.

Everything started out from [Calindra's](https://calindra.com.br) experience of years developing mobile apps, mainly for some of the biggest players in Brazil, to make their processes scalable, flexible, agile, safer and modular.

Its name comes from the mythological dwarf that forged Mj√∂lnir (Thor's Hammer) and other magical artifacts for the gods, showing incredible abilities as a blacksmith and builder. It's an analogy to the fact that building apps using Eitri can be so fast and practical that it can even seem like magic.

## Advantages

With Eitri, you can develop each feature in an independent and parallel way without interfering with other features or the mobile app where it's placed. Each Eitri-app has its own development and publish flow and they do not depend on app stores to be released, making it possible to publish changes instantly.

At least, to develop Eitri-apps, it's not necessary to work with native languages or hard-to-find professionals, so you can form developer teams in an easier and cheaper way.

## What are Eitri-apps?

Eitri-apps are small, independent applications that are integrated within your app once you install and configure Eitri in your mobile project.

These Eitri-apps have isolated codebases from each other and independent development and publish flows from each other and from the mobile app that hosts them. This allows each feature or product to be created as an Eitri-app and evolve at a different rhythm than the others, and without the need to do a mobile release on app stores.

## What can I do with Eitri?

You can build faster and easier with Eitri SDK. Take a look at our tools and resources and find out everything that Eitri can unlock for your teams. 

### Eitri SDK

Eitri SDK offers a lot of tools to allow your Eitri-apps to do amazing things:

#### [`Command Line Interface`](eitri-cli)

:   `Eitri CLI` is the starting point for those who want to develop Eitri-apps. From it, you can create and develop new Eitri-apps and run a lot of other cool functions.

#### [`Components and DS`](eitri-luminus)

:   The luminous bridge that represents a path to the door connecting the worlds in Nordic mythology has originated Eitri's components lib name `Eitri Luminus`. It packs the base components to create Eitri-apps and customization for the interface using your own color pallets and custom components for your organization.

#### [`API`](eitri-bifrost)

:   Bifrost is a mix of technology and magic that effectively connects the worlds in Nordic mythology and represents well what `Eitri Bifrost` does between your mobile app and the Eitri-apps universe. It empowers both of them, allowing your app to use Eitri features while making it possible to use functions of your app inside Eitri-apps.

#### [`Serverless Backend`](eitri-hugin)

:   Hugin (means "thought") is one of the two ravens of Odin and in Nordic mythology flies all over the world bringing Odin information that he needs. Our serverless backend feature called `Eitri Hugin` offers serverless functions to Eitri, allowing to create and run BFFs or backends for Eitri-apps for a variety of uses without needing to create or configure any infrastructure and making your Eitri-apps as powerfull as Odin itself.

#### [`Database and Persistence`](eitri-munin)

:   Munin (means "memory" or "mind") is the other raven of Odin and gives the name to our data persistency feature, `Eitri Munin`. With it, you can store information related to an Eitri-app in an easy, fast, and reliable way with a database, without the need to worry about infrastructure for it.

## How about my Design System?

You probably already have an app identity or visual characteristics that need to be followed by features inside your app, and that's why Eitri allows you to configure some of the basic Design System as a theme. This ensures your Eitri-apps look and feel exactly like your native experience, assuring consistency and a comfortable user experience.

It is possible to configure a color palette, create custom components that can be used while developing Eitri-apps, and once it's configured, all of your Eitri-apps will be created and developed respecting those visual definitions. This makes it easier to maintain visual consistency even between different teams and products.
