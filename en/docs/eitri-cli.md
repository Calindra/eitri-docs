# Eitri CLI

The Eitri CLI is the starting point for developing Eitri-Apps. With it, you can create, develop, and publish Eitri-Apps for your organizationâ€™s applications.

## Requirements

To use the Eitri CLI, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/){:target="_blank"} 18 or higher
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/){:target="_blank"}
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"}

## Installation

To install the CLI, use the command `npm install -g eitri-cli` in your terminal.

!!! info

    If you encounter any permission errors during installation, check if your user privileges are adequate/sufficient for the installation.

## Update

To update your CLI version, just use the command [eitri self-update](#self-update).

## Available Commands

You can use `--help` or `-h` at the end of any command to learn how to use it and explore its options.

Many of the additional functions of Eitri are available as options for the main commands.

### login

Usage: `eitri login [options]`

Logs into the Eitri platform, creating account credentials on your machine and linking your command-line tool to your Eitri developer account.

#### Available Options

- `yes` Accepts redirection to the Console.

!!! info

    Most other commands can only be executed after logging in.

---

### create

Usage: `eitri create [options] <project-name>`

Creates a new Eitri-App project on your machine and registers it on the Eitri platform.

You will need to provide some information when creating an Eitri-App:

`Application`
:   (The application in which your Eitri-App will run)

`Display Name`
:   Name used in the console listing. It is not displayed to the end client or user of the Eitri-App. This name is used internally and will not be visible to users.

`Marketing Name`
:   Product name, used in promotion and contact points with the user or end client. This name may be visible to users.

`Unique Name`
:   Also called slug, it is the name used for the unique identification of the Eitri-App on the Eitri platform, to find your Eitri-App, reference it in various circumstances, and also for building deep links. This name must not be repeated among Eitri-Apps and should not contain spaces or special characters.

#### Available Options

- `yes` Uses default values for name, title, and organization.
- `--application <application>` Allows you to define the application of the Eitri-App.
- `-v, --verbose` Displays detailed messages during command execution.

---

### start

Usage: `eitri start [options]`

The `eitri start` command initializes the Eitri-App for development, generating a QR Code that should be scanned with the app of your organization in which Eitri was integrated.

As you develop and save your files locally, your Eitri-App will have a hot-reload feature that shows the changes in real-time on your device, allowing you to quickly and easily see the final result.

#### Available Options

- `--initialization-params` Allows you to send initialization parameters to the Eitri-App, which facilitates development and testing.
- `-v, --verbose` Displays detailed messages during command execution.
- `-p, --playground` Initializes the Eitri-App in playground mode, with an opening QR code for the Eitri Playground.
- `-e, --emulator` Initializes the Eitri-App in emulator mode, with an opening QR code for the Eitri Emulator.
- `-sh, --shared` Initializes the Eitri-App in shared mode, with an opening QR code for the Eitri Shared.

### push-version

Usage: `eitri push-version [options]`

Uploads a version of your Eitri-App to the Console, enabling publication. When this command is executed, a version of your Eitri-App will be added to the console and will be available for publication in the registered environments for the application.

#### Available Options

- `-v, --verbose` Displays detailed messages during command execution.
- `-s, --shared` Uploads the shared version of your Eitri-App.
- `-m, --message <version-message>` Adds a message to the version of your Eitri-App.

!!! info

    Pay attention to the version of your Eitri-App (in the eitri-app.conf.js file) since you cannot upload an existing version in the console.

---

### self-update

Usage: `eitri self-update [options]`
