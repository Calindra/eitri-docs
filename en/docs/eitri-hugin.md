# Eitri Hugin

Hugin (which means "thought") is one of the two ravens of Odin who, in Norse mythology, fly all over the world bringing information to Odin.

Just like in mythology, Eitri's serverless functions feature allows you to create and run a BFF (backend for frontend) or backend for your Eitri-app for a variety of functions without the need to create or configure infrastructure for this purpose.

Hugin will soon be available for use in your Eitri-apps.
