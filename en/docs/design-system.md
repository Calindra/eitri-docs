# Design System

It's possible to define custom color palettes for each application using Eitri, ensuring that your Design System is respected across all Eitri-apps and utilizing pre-configured components to speed up the creation of your screens.

## Eitri Luminus

Eitri Luminus is Eitri's basic components library for building Eitri-app screens. With it, you can create more complex components for your Eitri-app experiences and further extend Eitri's possibilities in your app.

Eitri Luminus now includes [Tailwind 3](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/){:target="_blank"} and [DaisyUI 4](https://v4.daisyui.com/){:target="_blank"}

## Theme

A theme is a set of CSS-based style tokens that allows for the visual customization of Eitri-apps. It facilitates the creation and modification of designs, ensuring that the application meets the specific needs of users and brands.

Themes in Eitri are integrated into the application, allowing customizations directly in the [Console](https://console.eitri.tech/){:target="_blank"}. Designers and developers can quickly create or adjust the look of an application, with changes consistently reflected across all environments.

!!! warning "Attention"
    The theme is valid for all Eitri environments and is included at the time of version generation of Eitri-apps. Therefore, to apply a theme change to an Eitri-app, publish the theme change and generate a new version of your Eitri-app.
