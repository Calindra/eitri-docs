# Introduction

Eitri Luminus is the Eitri library that contains the basic components for assembling the screens of Eitri-apps.

With these components, you can create more complex components for your Eitri-apps' experiences and further extend the possibilities of Eitri in your app.

In addition, it's possible to set custom color palettes for each application using Eitri, ensuring that your Design System is respected in all Eitri-apps.
